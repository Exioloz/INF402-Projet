Comments. Comment lines give human-readable information about
the file and are ignored by programs. Comment lines appear at the
beginning of the preamble. Ea
h 
comment line begins with a lower-

ase 
hara
ter 
.

 This is an example of a 
Comment line.
 Problem line. There is one problem line per input file. The problem
line must appear before any node or ar
 des
riptor lines. For network
instan
es, the problem line has the following format.
p FORMAT VARIABLES
The lower-
ase 
hara
ter p signies that this is the problem line. The
FORMAT eld allows programs to determine the format that will be
expe
ted, and should 
ontain the word \sat". The VARIABLES eld

ontains an integer value spe
ifying n, the number of variables in the
instan
e. This line must o

ur as the last line of the preamble.

The Formula. Immediately after the problem statement, the formula
appears. This formula 
onsists of one or more lines, 
ontaining the formula
to be satised. The variables are represented by the numbers 1 through n.
Negation of a variable i is represented by i. Valid formulae are represented
by the following rules:
1. i and i are formula for all i.
2. If f is a valid formula, so is (f ).
3. If f is a valid formula, so is (f ).
4. If f1; f2; : : : ; fk are valid formulas, so is (f1 f2 : : : fk).
5. If f1; f2; : : : ; fk are valid formulas, so is +(f1 f2 : : : fk).

hara
ters. Whitespa
e is not required where the tokens are unambiguous without it. In parti
ular, both (1 {2) and (1-2) are valid formulae.
() and +() are valid and interpreted as TRUE and FALSE respe
tively.
The \" operator represents the and operation, the \+" represents the or
operation, and \" represents negation.
The formula represented must be of the form (f ), for a valid formula f .
Example. For the formula
(x1 _ x3 _ x4) ^ (x4) ^ (x2 _ x3)
